```

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Before running this script:

- Ensure the database `EmployeeManagementDB` exists.
- Ensure the `Employees` table exists with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT,
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    JoinDate DATE
);
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The DepartmentID column should match existing department values if foreign key constraints are enabled.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Script

1. Open **Command Prompt** or **Windows Terminal**.
2. Run the script using `sqlcmd`:

```bash
sqlcmd -S localhost -E -d EmployeeManagementDB -i "path\to\your_script.sql"
```

## üìå Notes

- Ensure the Departments and Employees tables are already created before executing this script.

- The INSERT and SELECT statements at the bottom of the script are test calls to verify that the stored procedures work correctly.

## ‚úÖ Expected Output

When the script runs successfully, you'll see the result of the select query for employees in Department ID 2.

### Sample output:

```yml
EmployeeID  FirstName   LastName   Salary    JoinDate
----------- ----------- ---------- --------- ----------
2           Jane        Smith      6000.00   2019-03-22
5           Alice       Williams   6200.00   2023-06-01
```

‚úÖ This confirms that the insert procedure worked and the new employee is correctly added.
